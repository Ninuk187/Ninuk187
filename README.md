- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ninuk187
- 👀 I’m interested in: Learning to program and ethical hacking
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: python (8-24-21) and gits syntaxes for the README.md lol 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: I'm actually open for suggestions for newbies.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm assuming there's a private messaging service through github.. I'll update of necessary.
